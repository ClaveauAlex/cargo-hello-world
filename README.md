# First program with Rust and Cargo

If you want to start a project with Rust. It could be interesting to start with Cargo!

You can just start with this command: `cargo new PROJECT_NAME`.

Then, cargo generated a directory with the name. If you choose to move into, you can see a file `Cargo.toml` and a directory `src/` with a file `main.rs`.

Cargo is a good practice when you choose to start a project. It can organize your project and initialize a versioning. So, use it!

It seperate the part with configuration like readme, confs, etc. and the project inside the directory `src/`.
